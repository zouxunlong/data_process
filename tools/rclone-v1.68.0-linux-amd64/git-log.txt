    gofile: fix failed downloads on newly uploaded objects
    
    The upload routine no longer returns a url to download the object.
    
    This fixes the problem by fetching it if necessary when we attempt to
    Open the object.

    gofile: fix Move a file
    
    For some reason the parent ID got out of date in the Object (exact
    reason not known - but the fact that this was OK before suggests a
    change in the provider).
    
    However we know the parent ID as it is in the directory cache, so use
    that instead.

    http: support listening on passed FDs
    
    Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all
    FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by
    `--{{ .Prefix }}addr`.
    
    This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service. It can be configured as described in
    https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html
    
    It's possible to test this interactively through `systemd-socket-activate`,
    firing of a request in a second terminal:
    
    ```
    ❯ systemd-socket-activate -l 8088 -l 8089 --fdname=foo:bar -- ./rclone serve webdav :local:test/
    Listening on [::]:8088 as 3.
    Listening on [::]:8089 as 4.
    Communication attempt on fd 3.
    Execing ./rclone (./rclone serve webdav :local:test/)

    build: update logging statements to make json log work - fixes #6038
    
    This changes log statements from log to fs package, which is required for --use-json-log
    to properly make log output in JSON format. The recently added custom linting rule,
    handled by ruleguard via gocritic via golangci-lint, warns about these and suggests
    the alternative. Fixing was therefore basically running "golangci-lint run --fix",
    although some manual fixup of mainly imports are necessary following that.

    Before this change all exports were exported as root and the --uid and

    This fixes the issue by exporting the UID and GID correctly which
    default to the current user and group unless set explicitly.

    zoho: fix inefficiencies uploading with new API to avoid throttling
    
    Before this fix, rclone queried the uploaded object to find its size
    and modtime after upload as the API did not return these items.
    
    Zoho have subsequently modified the API to return these items so
    rclone uses them to avoid an API call.
    
    This should help with rclone being throttled by Zoho.

    lib/file: use builtin MkdirAll with go1.22 instead of our own custom version for windows
    
    Starting with go1.22 the standard os.MkdirAll has improved its handling of volume names,
    and as part of that it now stops recursing into parent directory if it is a volume name
    (see: https://github.com/golang/go/commit/cd589c8a73415afbf94a8976f20cbed9d4061ba6).
    This is similar to what was our main change and reason for creating a custom version. When
    building with go1.22 or newer we can therefore stop using our custom version, with the
    advantage that we automatically get current and future relevant improvements from golang.
    To support building with go1.21 the existing custom version is still kept, and therefore
    also our wrapper function file.MkdirAll - but it now just calls os.MkdirAll with go1.22
    or newer on Windows.
    
    See #5401, #6420 and acf1e2df84a350b7a86d7672d749dfb1ba090a44 for details about the
    creation of our custom version of MkdirAll.

    bisync: don't convert modtime precision in listings - fixes #8025
    
    Before this change, bisync proactively converted modtime precision when greater
    than what the destination backend supported.
    
    This dates back to a time before bisync considered the modifyWindow for same-side
    comparisons. Back then, it was problematic to save a listing with 12:54:49.7 for
    a backend that can't handle that precision, as on the next run the backend would
    report the time as 12:54:50 and bisync would think the file had changed. So the
    truncation was a workaround to anticipate this and proactively record the time
    with the precision we expect to receive next time.
    
    However, this caused problems for backends (such as dropbox) that round instead
    of truncating as bisync expected.
    
    After this change, bisync preserves the original precision in the listing
    (without conversion), even when greater than what the backend supports, to avoid
    rounding error. On the next run, bisync will compare it to the rounded time
    reported by the backend, and if it's within the modifyWindow, it will treat them
    as equivalent.

    build: rename Unknwon/goconfig to unknwon/goconfig
    
    Before this change we used the repo with an initial uppercase `U`. However it is now canonically spelled with a lower case `u`.
    
    This package is too old to have a go.mod but the README clearly states the desired capitalization.
    
    In https://github.com/unknwon/goconfig/commit/4b0d4b818a95f1242556e08cbf9912d169cbade7 the
    recommended capitalization was changed to lower case.

    dlna: document external subtitle feature

Date:   Wed Dec 20 12:00:08 2023 +0200

    dlna: set more correct mime type
    
    The code currently hardcodes `text/srt` for all subtitles.
    
    `text/srt` is wrong, it seems `application/x-subrip` is the official
    extension coming from the official mime database, at least (and still
    works with the Samsung TV I tested with). Also add that one to `fs/
    mimetype.go`.
    
    Compared to previous iterations of this PR, I dropped tests ensuring
    certain mime types are present - as detection still seems to be fairly
    platform-specific.

    dlna: don't swallow video.{idx,sub}
    
    .idx and .sub subtitle files only work if both are present, but the code
    was overwriting the first-inserted element to subtitlesByName, as it was
    keyed by the basename without extension.
    
    Make subtitlesByName point to a slice of nodes instead.

    dlna: also look at "Subs" subdirectory
    
    Apparently it seems pretty common for subtitles to be put in a
    subdirectory called "Subs", rather than in the same directory as the
    media file itself.
    
    This covers that usecase, by checking the returned listing for a
    directory called "Subs" to exist.
    
    If it does, its child nodes are added to the list before they're being
    passed to mediaWithResources, allowing these subtitles to be discovered
    automatically.

    fstests: attempt to fix flaky serve s3 test
    
    Sometimes (particularly on macOS amd64) the serve s3 test fails with
    TestIntegration/FsMkdir/FsPutError where it wasn't expecting to get an
    object but it did.
    
    This is likely caused by a race between the serve s3 goroutine
    deleting the half uploaded file and the fstests code looking for it to
    not exist.
    
    This fix treats it like any other eventual consistency problem and
    retries the check using the test framework.

    local: --local-no-clone flag to disable cloning for server-side copies
    
    This flag allows users to disable the reflink cloning feature and instead force
    "deep" copies, for certain use cases where data redundancy is preferable. It is
    functionally equivalent to using `--disable Copy` on local.

    local: support setting custom --metadata during server-side Copy

commit 87ec26001f399cd1fe728a98d78c1b6ec4f0d322
Author: nielash <nielronash@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 28 12:30:47 2023 -0500

    local: add server-side copy with xattrs on macOS (part-fix #1710)
    
    Before this change, macOS-specific metadata was not preserved by rclone, even for
    local-to-local transfers (it does not use the "user." prefix, nor is Mac metadata
    limited to xattrs.) Additionally, rclone did not take advantage of APFS's native
    "cloning" functionality for fast and deduplicated transfers.
    
    After this change, local (on macOS only) supports "server-side copy" similarly to
    other remotes, and achieves this by using (when possible) macOS's native APFS
    "cloning", which is the same underlying mechanism deployed when a user
    duplicates a file via the Finder UI. This has several advantages over the
    previous behavior:
    
    - It is extremely fast (even large files can be cloned instantly)
    - It is very efficient in terms of storage, as it automatically deduplicates when
    possible (i.e. so that having two identical files does not consume more storage
    than having just one.) (The concept is similar to a "hard link", but subsequent
    modifications will not affect the original file.)
    - It preserves Mac-specific metadata to the maximum degree, including not only
    xattrs but also metadata not easily settable by other methods, including Finder
    and Spotlight params.
    
    When server-side "clone" is not available (for example, on non-APFS volumes), it
    falls back to server-side "copy" (still preserving metadata but using more disk
    storage.) It is only used when both remotes are local (and not wrapped by other
    remotes, such as crypt.) The behavior of local on non-mac systems is unchanged.

    webdav: add --webdav-unix-socket-path to connect to a unix socket
    
    This adds a new optional parameter to the backend, to specify a path
    to a unix domain socket to connect to, instead the specified URL.
    
    The URL itself is still used for the rest of the HTTP client, allowing
    host and subpath to stay intact.
    
    This allows using rclone with the webdav backend to connect to a WebDAV

    s3: fix Cloudflare R2 integration tests after SDKv2 update #4989
    
    Cloudflare will normally automatically decompress files with
    `Content-Encoding: gzip` when downloaded. This is not what AWS S3 does
    and it breaks the integration tests.
    
    This fudges the integration tests to upload the test file with
    `Cache-Control: no-transform` on Cloudflare R2 and puts a note in the
    docs about this problem.

    fs/http: reload client certificates on expiry
    
    In corporate environments, client certificates have short life times
    for added security, and they get renewed automatically. This means
    that client certificate can expire in the middle of long running
    command such as `mount`.
    
    This commit attempts to reload the client certificates 30s before they
    expire.
    
    This will be active for all backends which use HTTP.

    pikpak: correct file transfer progress for uploads by hash
    
    Pikpak can accelerate file uploads by leveraging existing content
    in its storage (identified by a custom hash called gcid).
    Previously, file transfer statistics were incorrect for uploads
    without outbound traffic as the input stream remained unchanged.
    
    This commit addresses the issue by:
    
    * Removing unnecessary unwrapping/wrapping of accountings
    before/after gcid calculation, leading immediate AccountRead() on buffering.
    * Correctly tracking file transfer statistics for uploads
    with no incoming/outgoing traffic by marking them as Server Side Copies.
    
    This change ensures correct statistics tracking and improves overall user experience.

    reflect.SliceHeader is deprecated, however the replacement gives a go

    pikpak: optimize upload by pre-fetching gcid from API
    
    This commit optimizes the PikPak upload process by pre-fetching the Global
    Content Identifier (gcid) from the API server before calculating it locally.
    
    Previously, a gcid required for uploads was calculated locally. This process was
    resource-intensive and time-consuming. By first checking for a cached gcid
    on the server, we can potentially avoid the local calculation entirely.
    This significantly improves upload speed especially for large files.

    local: fix encoding of root path
    fix #7824
    Statements like rclone copy <somewhere> . will spontaneously miss
    if . expands to a path with a Full Width replacement character.
    This is due to the incorrect order in which
    relative paths and decoding were handled in the original implementation.

    vfs: fix cache encoding with special characters - #7760
    
    The vfs use the hardcoded OS encoding when creating temp file,
    but decode it with encoding for the local filesystem (--local-encoding)
    when copying it to remote.
    This caused failures when the filenames contained special characters.
    The hardcoded OS encoding is now used uniformly.

    This only uses sscan for integers and uses the correct routine for

    sftp: use uint32 for mtime
    
    The SFTP protocol (and the golang sftp package) internally uses uint32 unix
    time for expressing mtime. Hence it is a waste of memory to store it as 24-byte
    time.Time data structure in long-lived data structures. So despite that the
    golang sftp package uses time.Time as external interface, we can re-encode the
    value back to the original format and save memory.

    pikpak: optimize file move by removing unnecessary `readMetaData()` call
    
    Previously, the code relied on calling `readMetaData()` after every file move operation.
    This introduced an unnecessary API call and potentially impacted performance.
    
    This change removes the redundant `readMetaData()` call, improving efficiency.

    pikpak: fix error with `copyto` command
    
    Fixes an issue where copied files could not be renamed when using the
    `copyto` command. This occurred because the object ID was empty
    before calling `readMetaData`. The fix preemptively calls `readMetaData`
    to ensure an object ID is available before attempting the rename operation.

    swift: add workarounds for bad listings in Ceph RGW
    
    Ceph's Swift API emulation does not fully confirm to the API spec.
    As a result, it sometimes returns fewer items in a container than
    the requested limit, which according to the spec should means
    that there are no more objects left in the container.  (Note that
    python-swiftclient always fetches unless the current page is empty.)
    
    This commit adds a pair of new Swift backend settings to handle this.
    
    Set `fetch_until_empty_page` to true to always fetch another
    page of the container listing unless there are no items left.
    
    Alternatively, set `partial_page_fetch_threshold` to an integer
    percentage.  In this case rclone will fetch a new page only when
    the current page is within this percentage of the limit.

    onedrive: fix nil pointer error when uploading small files
    
    Before this fix when uploading a single part file, if the
    o.fetchAndUpdateMetadata() call failed rclone would call
    o.setMetaData() with a nil info which caused a crash.
    
    This fixes the problem by returning the error from
    o.fetchAndUpdateMetadata() explicitly.

    vfs: fix fatal error: sync: unlock of unlocked mutex in panics
    
    Before this change a panic could be overwritten with the message
    
        fatal error: sync: unlock of unlocked mutex
    
    This was because we temporarily unlocked the mutex, but failed to lock
    it again if there was a panic.
    
    This is code is never the cause of an error but it masks the
    underlying error by overwriting the panic cause.

    pikpak: improves data consistency by ensuring async tasks complete
    
    Similar to uploads implemented in commit ce5024bf3317dbbe2072abda15036e2d8507d3fd,
    this change ensures most asynchronous file operations (copy, move, delete,
    purge, and cleanup) complete before proceeding with subsequent actions.
    This reduces the risk of data inconsistencies and improves overall reliability.

    docs: fix hugo warning: found no layout file for "html" for kind "term"
    
    Hugo has been making this warning for a while
    
    WARN found no layout file for "html" for kind "term": You should
    create a template file which matches Hugo Layouts Lookup Rules for
    this combination.
    
    This turned out to be the addition of the `groups:` keyword to the
    command frontmatter. Hugo is doing something with this keyword though
    this isn't documented in the frontmatter documentation.
    
    The fix was removing the `groups:` keyword from the frontmatter since
    it was never used by hugo.
