The additional corpus is organised into a few parts. 



Under Part 4, speakers were encouraged as best as possible to switch from Singapore English to their Mother Tongue languages. These recordings were done under two environments. In the Same Room recordings, speakers sit at least two metres apart and record using their mobile phones. In the Different Room environment, speakers would speak through each other via Zoom on their laptops, and recording using their mobile phones. 
Under Part 5, speakers were made to speak following the 4 styles: Debate, Finance topics, Positive Emotion and Negative Emotions. All recordings were done in a Separate room session, via Zoom, where the audio is recorded using the mobile phone. 
Under Part 6, speakers were made to speak following the 3 styles within either of the 3 designs: Design 1 (holiday/hotel/restaurant), Design 2 (bank, telephone, insurance), Design 3 (HDB, MOE, MSF). All recordings were done in a Separate room session, via Zoom, where the audio is recorded using the mobile phone.
