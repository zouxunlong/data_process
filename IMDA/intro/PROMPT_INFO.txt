The audio uttered by speakers with accompanying transcripts in Part 2 originated from scripts which had been randomly generated from words based on people, food, location, brands, etc.

All statements in the scripts are entirely fictitious and any portions of the randomly generated scripts which may refer to actual situations/events is entirely coincidental.
